# Database description
We will build a database to store resources that will hopefully encourage women to pursue a career in tech. As the number of women in tech is on an increasing trend, we'd like to further this trend by producing a useful database. This database will help women find fellow members near them, or in certain countries/regions to network amongst themselves. The database will also help women see what workshops/events are present related to their field and/or region. As well as current jobs, interested fields, future plans, and available scholarships. It will also contain tables for members interested in being a mentor and mentees. The main application that could would use this database is a web app (front end) to the back-end database. However, other applications could include data analysis tools geared at figuring out how to market things better. Then another application can be a financial tool to see what parts need more/less funding. But these are only a small list of possible applications that could be able to use this database, as with an API the possible number of applications used could potentially be endless. This database is original, because even though there are resources available, they do lack in some areas, so we believe that our data base does a better way of wrangling different useful sources into one medium.
